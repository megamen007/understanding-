// reinterpret cast converts any pointer type to any other pointer type.

// reinterpret cast is a very special and dangerous type of casting operator.
// it can typecast any pointer to any other data type .

// it is used when we want to work with bits .
// if we use this type of cast then it becomes a non portable product .
// it is only used to typecast any pointer to its original type .

// bolean value will be converted into integer values.

// reinterpret_cast is a type of type casting operator in C++ that allows you to reinterpret the binary 
//representation of an object pointer or data pointer and convert it into another type, regardless of
// whether the types are related or not. It's the most powerful and least restrictive among all the casting operators in C++

// it is used for low level manipulations 

// reintrepret cast bypasses most of the type safety mechanisms provided by c++ language .
// its generally recommended to avoid it when its possible
